I'll create a complete example with test data that demonstrates how to use the VRPTW optimizer.



```python
import gurobipy as gp
from gurobipy import GRB
import numpy as np
import time

# First copy the entire VRPTWOptimizer class from the previous artifact here
# [Previous VRPTWOptimizer class code goes here]

    locations = {
        0: (0, 0),    # Depot start
        1: (2, 4),    # Customer 1
        2: (-1, 3),   # Customer 2

                costs[i,j] = int(np.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2) * 10)  # Scale by 10 for integer distances

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

To run this example:

1. Save both the `VRPTWOptimizer` class and this example code in a Python file
2. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install gurobipy numpy
```
3. You'll need a Gurobi license (they offer free academic licenses)
4. Run the script

The example creates a small instance with:
- 5 customers
- 1 depot (start and end points)
- Euclidean distances scaled by 10
- Time windows for each customer
- Realistic demands and vehicle capacity
- Local area neighbors based on proximity
- Simplified time and capacity buckets

The solver will try to find the optimal solution within 5 minutes and print detailed information about the routes found, including:
- Total distance
- Individual route distances
- Vehicle loads
- Arrival times at each customer

Would you like me to provide any clarification or help with running the example?
